# Gold_Price_Predictor
Random forest regression is used to predict the price of gold.

## About:
1. In this project, we are not forecasting gold prices; instead, we are predicting the gold price based on other parameters.

2. We can observe the correlation between gold price and other attributes with the help of a heatmap.

3. The interesting thing is that the silver price is strongly correlated with the gold price.

4. We will use the Random Forest algorithm to train our model.

5. The R squared error is not justifying our predictions as it is coming in too large; therefore, we plotted the actual price of gold and the predicted price of gold, and we can see that the predicted prices are pretty close.
