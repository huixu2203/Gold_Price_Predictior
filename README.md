# Gold_Price_Predictior
Random Forest Regression is used to predict the price of gold.

## About:
1. In this project we are not forecasting the gold prices, instead we are predicting the gold price based on other parameters.

2. We can observe the correlation between Gold price and other attributes with the help of heatmap.

3. The interesting thing is that silver price is strongly correlated with the gold price.

4. We will use Random Forest algorithmto train our model.

5. The R Squared error is not justifying our predictions as it is comming too large, therefore we plotted the actual price of gold and predicted price of gold and we can see that the predicted prices are pretty close.
